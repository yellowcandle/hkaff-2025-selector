# Task Completion Checklist - HKAFF 2025 Selector

## After Each Task Completion

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (see code_style_conventions memory)
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined and used
- [ ] No console.log statements or debug code left in production code
- [ ] Error handling is implemented with descriptive messages
- [ ] Component props are properly typed with JSDoc comments

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests written for all new services/utilities
- [ ] Component tests written for UI components
- [ ] Tests follow TDD pattern (fail first, then implement)
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements (≥80% for services)
- [ ] All tests pass before marking task complete

### Integration Validation
- [ ] New code integrates with existing components/services
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] LocalStorage schema changes include migration logic
- [ ] i18n keys are added for both TC and EN languages
- [ ] Responsive design works at all breakpoints

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Bundle size impact is minimal (<5KB increase per task)
- [ ] Component renders are optimized (React.memo where appropriate)
- [ ] No memory leaks in event listeners or timers
- [ ] Image loading is optimized (lazy loading for posters)
- [ ] Interaction response time is <1 second

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] JSDoc comments added to all public methods
- [ ] Component props documented
- [ ] Service interfaces updated if contracts changed
- [ ] README or usage examples updated if needed
- [ ] Task marked as [X] in tasks.md with commit reference

## Phase-Specific Checklists

### Phase 3.1: Setup Tasks (T001-T006)
- [ ] Project structure created according to plan
- [ ] Dependencies installed and versions locked
- [ ] Configuration files (tailwind, vitest, playwright) are functional
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] Test runners execute without configuration errors

### Phase 3.2: Data Extraction (T007-T013)
- [ ] Scraper successfully extracts all required data
- [ ] JSON files match schema validation (contracts/data-schema.json)
- [ ] Data integrity checks pass (no missing foreign keys)
- [ ] Bilingual content properly separated (TC/EN)
- [ ] Output files placed in correct location (frontend/public/data/)
- [ ] Scraper handles edge cases (missing data, network errors)

### Phase 3.3: Tests First (T014-T034)
- [ ] All contract tests FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- [ ] Unit tests cover all edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] E2E tests cover all user scenarios from quickstart.md
- [ ] Test files follow naming conventions and structure
- [ ] Mock data is realistic and comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are independent and can run in parallel

### Phase 3.4: Service Implementation (T035-T041)
- [ ] All services implement their corresponding interfaces
- [ ] Contract tests now PASS (implementation matches contracts)
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure modes
- [ ] Services are stateless where possible
- [ ] LocalStorage operations include migration support
- [ ] Conflict detection algorithm handles all edge cases

### Phase 3.5: Component Implementation (T042-T052)
- [ ] Components are reusable and testable in isolation
- [ ] Props interface is minimal and well-defined
- [ ] Components use i18n for all user-facing text
- [ ] Responsive design works at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
- [ ] Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Loading states and error states are handled

### Phase 3.6: Integration (T053-T059)
- [ ] Data flows correctly between services and components
- [ ] State management is centralized and predictable
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully
- [ ] Language switching updates all UI text instantly
- [ ] Schedule view reflects real-time changes
- [ ] Export functionality generates correct markdown format

### Phase 3.7: Responsive Design (T060-T064)
- [ ] Layout adapts smoothly at all breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1280px)
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44px)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
- [ ] Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- [ ] Interactive elements have proper spacing on touch devices
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on mobile networks

### Phase 3.8: Polish (T065-T074)
- [ ] All test suites pass with required coverage
- [ ] Production bundle meets size targets (<180KB gzipped)
- [ ] Lighthouse score meets performance targets (≥90)
- [ ] All 10 quickstart scenarios validate successfully
- [ ] Code is production-ready (no debug code, proper error handling)
- [ ] Manual testing confirms smooth user experience

## Final Validation Before Task Sign-off

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Run these commands before marking any task complete
npm run typecheck      # No TypeScript errors
npm run lint          # No linting warnings/errors
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests pass
npm run test:contract # Contract tests pass (if applicable)
```

### Manual Checks
- [ ] Feature works as described in the task
- [ ] No visual regressions in the UI
- [ ] Performance feels responsive to user interaction
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and user-friendly
- [ ] Feature works in both languages (TC/EN)
- [ ] Mobile and desktop experience are both acceptable

### Git Requirements
- [ ] Changes are committed with descriptive message
- [ ] Task ID is referenced in commit message
- [ ] No sensitive data is committed
- [ ] .gitignore is properly configured
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main if needed

## Quality Gates

### Must Pass Before Proceeding to Next Phase
- **Setup → Data Extraction**: Development environment fully functional
- **Data Extraction → Tests**: All JSON files validate against schemas
- **Tests → Services**: All tests FAIL (TDD requirement)
- **Services → Components**: All contract tests PASS
- **Components → Integration**: All components render without errors
- **Integration → Polish**: All user scenarios work end-to-end
- **Polish → Complete**: All validation criteria met

### Performance Gates
- Bundle size increase <5KB per task
- Interaction response time <1 second
- Memory usage stable during extended use
- No layout shifts or visual glitches

Remember: Quality is more important than speed. A task is not complete until it meets all criteria in this checklist.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies between them
- **TDD Enforcement**: All tests (T014-T034) MUST FAIL before implementing services (T035-T041)
- **Scraper First**: Data extraction (T007-T013) must complete before any tests can validate data
- **Integration Last**: Components and services must exist before wiring together (T053-T059)
- **Responsive Design**: Apply mobile-first approach (T060-T064)
- **Polish Phase**: Run all validations before considering feature complete (T065-T074)
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each completed task ID

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - data-schema.json → T014-T017 (contract tests for each JSON file)
   - service-interfaces.ts → T018-T022 (contract tests for each service interface)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 6 entities (Film, Screening, Venue, Category, UserSelection, Schedule) → T035-T040 (service implementations)
   - Conflict detection algorithm → T023, T037 (unit test + implementation)

3. **From Quickstart**:
   - 10 user scenarios → T027-T034 (E2E tests)
   - Performance metrics → T068, T069 (bundle size, Lighthouse)
   - Responsive validation → T064 (breakpoint testing)

4. **From Research**:
   - Playwright scraping → T007-T013 (data extraction tasks)
   - Tech stack setup → T001-T006 (Vite, React, Tailwind, testing tools)

## Validation Checklist

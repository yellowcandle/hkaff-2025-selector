## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: How should user screening selections be preserved across sessions? ‚Üí A: Browser local storage only (no login required, device-specific)
- Q: When a user selects overlapping screenings, how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Warn only (allow conflicting selections, show warning message)
- Q: How should the app obtain film and screening data from the HKAFF catalogue? ‚Üí A: Static import (one-time data snapshot, no updates)
- Q: How should the app support Traditional Chinese and English? ‚Üí A: In-app language toggle (user switches language within app)
- Q: How should the user's schedule organize selected screenings chronologically? ‚Üí A: By date with time shown (grouped by day, ordered by time within each day)
- Q: Should users be able to export their schedule? ‚Üí A: Yes, markdown export for copy/paste from web
- Q: Should the app display ticket availability or sold-out status for screenings? ‚Üí A: No ticket integration (show all screenings regardless of availability)
- Q: How should the app work on mobile and desktop devices? ‚Üí A: Responsive web design (single app adapts to screen size)
- Q: What is the acceptable response time for user interactions (clicking to view film details, selecting screenings, switching language)? ‚Üí A: < 1 second

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A film festival attendee wants to browse the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival 2025 catalogue, select screenings they want to attend based on films, times, and venues, and create a personalized schedule to manage their festival experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the app on any device, **When** they view the film catalogue, **Then** they see all available films with details (title, category, venue options) in their selected language (TC or EN) with layout adapted to their screen size
1a. **Given** a user is viewing the app, **When** they use the language toggle, **Then** all interface text and film information switches to the selected language
2. **Given** a user browses films, **When** they select a film they want to see, **Then** they can choose from available screening times and venues
3. **Given** a user has selected multiple screenings, **When** they view their schedule, **Then** they see all selected screenings grouped by date, ordered by time within each day, with venue information
4. **Given** a user has selected screenings, **When** there is a time conflict between two selections, **Then** they see a warning message but both selections remain in their schedule
5. **Given** a user has created a schedule, **When** they return to the app later on the same device/browser, **Then** their selections are preserved from browser local storage
6. **Given** a user views their schedule, **When** they need to remove a screening, **Then** they can deselect it and it's removed from their schedule
7. **Given** a user has created a schedule, **When** they request to export it, **Then** they receive a markdown-formatted version they can copy and paste

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user selects screenings at different venues with tight timing that may be impossible to attend? System warns about time overlap but allows the selection.
- How does the system handle sold-out screenings? App does not integrate ticket availability; all screenings are shown regardless of sold-out status.
- What happens if screening times or venues change after a user has made selections? Data is static; changes in official schedule are not reflected in app.
- Can users export their schedule? Yes, users can export to markdown format for copy/paste.

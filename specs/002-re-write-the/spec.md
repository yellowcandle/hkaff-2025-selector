# Feature Specification: Frontend UI Rewrite Using Figma Mockup

**Feature Branch**: `002-re-write-the`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "re-write the frontend UI using the figma mock up at https://www.figma.com/make/xSJQeigKcA5DqdpwOnhnm2/Film-Festival-Scheduler?node-id=0-1&t=ULGVZZimyiMz1MM7-1 you can complete re-write the frontend"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17
- Q: What specific aspects of the Figma mockup must be matched exactly? ‚Üí A: Visual design plus basic interactions (hover, click states)
- Q: What are the accessibility standards to be met? ‚Üí A: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Q: Are there any performance targets for the new UI? ‚Üí A: no
- Q: How many films are expected to be displayed? ‚Üí A: fewer than 100
- Q: Is there any authentication or user data protection required? ‚Üí A: Basic user preferences storage (local only, no server)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Film festival attendees should be able to browse and select films through a completely redesigned user interface that matches the provided Figma mockup, providing an improved and modern user experience while maintaining all existing functionality for film discovery and scheduling.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the film festival website, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** the interface should match the Figma mockup's visual design (colors, typography, spacing, layout) and basic interactions (hover, click states)
2. **Given** a user browses film listings, **When** they interact with film cards and filters, **Then** all existing functionality should work within the new UI design
3. **Given** a user selects films for their schedule, **When** they view their selections, **Then** the schedule interface should reflect the new design while preserving all scheduling capabilities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users access the site on mobile devices - does the design remain usable?
- How does the system handle users with different screen sizes and resolutions?
- What occurs if the Figma design includes interactive elements not currently implemented?
- How should the system behave if certain design elements conflict with accessibility requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the homepage interface with visual design (colors, typography, spacing, layout) and basic interactions (hover, click states) matching the Figma mockup
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all existing film browsing and filtering functionality within the new UI design
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all film selection and scheduling capabilities in the redesigned interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure the new UI design is fully responsive across different device sizes
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in the new design
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all interactive elements from the Figma mockup function as intended
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve existing user preferences and saved schedules (stored locally) during the UI transition
- **FR-008**: System MUST support displaying fewer than 100 films

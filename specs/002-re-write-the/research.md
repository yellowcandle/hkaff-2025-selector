# Research Findings: Frontend UI Rewrite Using Figma Mockup

## Decision: Framework Selection - React
**Rationale**: Existing codebase uses React (confirmed by package.json and component structure). Maintaining consistency avoids migration overhead and leverages existing team knowledge.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vue.js: Popular alternative, but would require full migration of existing components
- Svelte: Lightweight, but steeper learning curve and less ecosystem maturity for complex UIs

## Decision: Figma Fidelity Approach - Visual Design + Basic Interactions
**Rationale**: Based on clarification, match visual elements (colors, typography, spacing, layout) and basic interactions (hover, click states). This balances design accuracy with implementation feasibility while avoiding complex animations that may not be defined in the mockup.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pixel-perfect match: Too rigid, may not account for responsive needs or accessibility requirements
- Complete fidelity with animations: Mockup may not specify all interactions, leading to guesswork

## Decision: Responsive Design Pattern - Mobile-First CSS Grid/Flexbox
**Rationale**: Constitution requires mobile-first approach. Use CSS Grid for layout structure and Flexbox for component alignment, ensuring touch targets meet 44px minimum.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Desktop-first approach: Violates constitution principle III
- Framework-specific grids (e.g., Bootstrap): Adds unnecessary dependencies when native CSS is sufficient

## Decision: Accessibility Implementation - WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
**Rationale**: Clarified requirement specifies WCAG 2.1 AA. Implement semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed, keyboard navigation, and color contrast ratios.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- WCAG 2.0 AA: Less comprehensive than 2.1, especially for mobile/touch interactions
- WCAG 2.1 AAA: Overly strict for this application, may limit design flexibility

## Decision: i18n Integration - Maintain Existing i18next Setup
**Rationale**: Constitution requires bilingual support. Preserve existing i18next configuration and add new translation keys for any new UI text introduced in the rewrite.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom translation system: Would violate constitution principle II
- English-only for new elements: Blocks PR merge per constitution

## Decision: Testing Strategy - Maintain Playwright E2E + Vitest Unit
**Rationale**: Existing test setup aligns with constitution TDD requirements. Update E2E tests to validate new UI against acceptance scenarios, add unit tests for new components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Switch to different testing framework: Unnecessary disruption to established workflow
- Reduce test coverage: Violates constitution quality gates

## Decision: Data Handling - Preserve LocalStorage for User Preferences
**Rationale**: Clarified that user preferences are stored locally. Ensure new UI maintains compatibility with existing LocalStorage schema.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-side storage: Would require backend, violating single-source-of-truth principle
- No persistence: Would break existing functionality preservation requirement

## Decision: Scale Considerations - Optimize for <100 Films
**Rationale**: Confirmed scale is <100 films. No virtualization needed; standard React rendering sufficient. Focus on clean, maintainable component structure.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Virtualization libraries (e.g., react-window): Overkill for small dataset
- Pagination: Unnecessary complexity for small scale
